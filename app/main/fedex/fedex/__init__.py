python-fedex API Documentation
==============================
The python-fedex module is a light wrapper around Fedex's Web Services SOAP API.
Using the excellent U{suds<https://fedorahosted.org/suds/>} SOAP client,
the Fedex requests and responses are trivial to work with.

What python-fedex is
--------------------
    - A light wrapper around Fedex Web Services SOAP API.
    - Simple and easy to use.
    - Minimal by design.

What python-fedex is not
------------------------
    - An abstraction layer. python-fedex only assembles the needed SOAP calls
        and returns a SOAP response through suds. This is easy enough to work with
        that no abstraction is needed. Doing so would limit your use of the data.
    - Anything more than a light wrapper.
    
A note on completeness
----------------------
python-fedex was created for use with various internal projects over the years.
Not all services are implemented but only those needed at the time were implemented.
If there is missing functionality, please report an U{issue<http://code.google.com/p/python-fedex/issues/list>}
so that this module can be made more useful to others. Likewise, feel free to
submit patches and service implementations as well if you would like to help.

Getting Started
---------------
The best place to get started is by viewing the examples in the 'examples'
directory. These should be very self-explanatory. For further details, you
may review the API here, or get support by reading the instructions in the
appropriately named section below.

The L{services} module is also a good place to start looking at the different
objects used for issuing Fedex requests.

As a general tip, the best way to see which attributes are available on WSDL
objects is to simply print them, hitting their __str__() method.

Fedex Documentation
-------------------
If you are wondering what attributes or variables are present, you'll want to
refer to the Fedex Web Services documentation at http://fedex.com/developer/.
Complete specification documents are there, which correspond very closely with
what you'll be able to do with python-fedex.
