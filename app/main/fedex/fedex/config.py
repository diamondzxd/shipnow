"""
The L{config} module contains the L{FedexConfig} class, which is passed to
the Fedex API calls. It stores useful information such as your Web Services
account numbers and keys.

It is strongly suggested that you create a single L{FedexConfig} object in
your project and pass that to the various API calls, rather than create new
L{FedexConfig} objects haphazardly. This is merely a design suggestion,
treat it as such.
